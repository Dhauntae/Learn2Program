# Learn2Program

I am currently engaged in Learn2Program.tv's Framework Professional Developers BootCamp.  I currently have beginner to intermediate working knowledge and practice with: Mac, Windows, and Linux; .bat files & scripts; command line operation and editing; macros; and some Visual Basic and Python.

I try to stay current with most current news, stories, and updates concerning our CodeWorld and how it improves our lives and enables us to come togther in comradery, cooperation, mentoring, and sharing.

It is a powerful thing when people with like minds and interests come together with conviction and purpose.  It's what makes coding so fun to learn and use.

I am very grateful for all who might, have, or will encounter me, help me, and give me guidance.  May my adventures and achievements be excellent and may I make new friends along the way.
